The line chart displays the total number of trips by hour and month. It consists of multiple lines, each representing a different month, and shows how the number of trips changes over the hours of the day for each month.


The x-axis represents the hour of the day, ranging from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11 PM). The y-axis represents the total number of trips. Each line on the chart represents a different month, with a unique color to differentiate between them.

By examining the lines, you can observe how the number of trips varies by hour of the day for each month. For example, you may notice that there are higher trip counts during certain hours of the day in specific months, while other hours have lower trip counts. This information can help identify patterns or trends in the data, such as peak hours of demand or changes in travel behavior by month.


## Chart that displays Trips Every Hour.

The chart is a bar chart that shows the total number of trips for each hour of the day. It consists of vertical bars, with each bar representing a different hour of the day. The height of each bar represents the total number of trips that occurred during that specific hour.

The x-axis represents the hours of the day, ranging from 0 (midnight) to 23 (11 PM). The y-axis represents the total number of trips. Each bar on the chart represents a different hour of the day, and the height of the bar indicates the total number of trips that occurred during that hour.

By examining the heights of the bars, you can see the distribution of trips throughout the day. This can help identify patterns, trends, or peaks in trip counts during certain hours, which can be useful for understanding travel patterns and demand for transportation services during different times of the day.


## Plot data by trips taken during every day of the month.

The chart is a line chart that shows the total number of trips for each day of the month. It consists of a line that connects data points, with each data point representing a different day of the month. The position of each data point on the chart represents the day of the month along the x-axis, and the total number of trips on that day along the y-axis.

The x-axis represents the days of the month, ranging from the 1st day to the last day of the month. The y-axis represents the total number of trips. The line on the chart connects the data points, showing the trend of trips taken over the course of the month.

A table that shows trips every day presents data in a tabular format with rows for each day and columns for attributes such as date and total trips. It allows for easy comparison and analysis of daily trip counts.

By examining the shape of the line and the position of the data points, you can see the overall trend of trips taken during the month. This can help identify patterns, trends, or peaks in trip counts during certain days of the month, which can be useful for understanding travel patterns and demand for transportation services throughout the month.
